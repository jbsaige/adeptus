20150308 - 2'00" - Research - Watched videos of gameplay for Archon II.  The powerwells move (predictably) each round.  The armageddon mode is one adept vs another.  There are less powerwells.  The battlegrounds are simple, black screen with elemental obsticales.
20150309 - 0'45" - World Scene - Moved tutorial canvas into the overlay.  Updated calculations for world to screen.
20150314 - 1'00" - World Scene - Tutorial now runs on an enabled/disabled flag.  This is to setup for being able to turn it off mid-game.
20150315 - 0'30" - Battle Scene (Air) - Disabled cyclones.
20150315 - 0'15" - Research - The Battle Scene (Void) can be used to replace the other battle scenes, to make it more like the orginial.
--------
20150323 - Drive failure. Some updates were committed to github and bitbucket.  However, the updates to this file were excluded.  Will attempt to reconstruct.  Last commit was 20150315.  The changes after that point are lost, and will have to be reconstructed.
--------
20150324 - 0'30" - Battle Scene (All) - Updated each weapon so that they are balanced.
20150324 - 0'10" - Updated the spawn positions so that they are on the screen.
20150324 - 0'10" - World Manager - Moved the GameMode to the GameManager so that the mode survives battles.
20150324 - 2'15" - Battle Scene (Armageddon) - Tested armageddon mode, it triggers properly.  The end game screen (victory or defeat) needs to be displayed.
20150325 - 0'30" - Created EndGame Scene.
20150326 - 1'00" - EndGame Scene - Setup triggers and buttons and functions.  Now loads when it should.
20150326 - 1'45" - Battle Scene (All) - Troubleshooting in class.  Battle hangs at end.
20150329 - 3'00" - git - Poured over all the changes since the last good compile on 20150309.  Attempted to revert the code to the commit during that time.  Created branch Unity_4.6.  Battle scene hangs now when enemy fires a shot.  Troubleshooting failed.
20150330 - 3'30" - Prefabs, Scripts - Switched back to master branch.  The battle scene does not hang when the S key is held down during battle end.  Odd?  Went through all the errors and warnings and applied the missing elements indicated.  The EndGame scene loads more often now, but not always.  Odd still?  The quit button does not work.  Application.Quit() appears to do nothing. Odd?
20150331 - 3'30" - The battle does not hang when Visual Studio is attached, nor when running compiled.  Odd?  Having set breakpoints and traced the call-stack through, I do not know where the fault is.  Further, it appears that not all of the data is returning from the battle.  The GameManager no longer knows (without counting) where the power wells are.
20150402 - 1'00" - Reverted some changes to the enemy prefabs that were causing it to shoot itself.
